# Transforming XML messages into JSON and JSON messages into XML without using the [TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorksâ„¢ Plug-in for REST and JSON](https://docs.tibco.com/products/tibco-activematrix-businessworks-plug-in-for-rest-and-json-2-1-0).

In this "How To", I will illustrate the process of transforming XML messages into JSON and JSON messages into XML. TIBCO offers a plugin that facilitates these transformations, along with other features, and **obtaining a license for its use is the recommended and proper approach**. However, some companies may choose not to acquire this plugin. In such cases, as developers, we must explore alternative solutions for achieving these transformations.

For this example, I will use the following message as a foundation:


~~~xml
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>
<users>
	<user>
		<id>1</id>
		<name>user01</name>
		<email>user01@email.com</email>
	</user>
	<user>
		<id>2</id>
		<name>user02</name>
		<email>user02@email.com</email>
	</user>
	<user>
		<id>3</id>
		<name>user03</name>
		<email>user03@email.com</email>
	</user>
</users>
~~~


## Let's get started...!

1- Create a new TIBCO BW project; I named it **XML_TO_JSON_AND_JSON_TO_XML**, but you can change it as needed.

2- Create the folder structure to accommodate the XSD schema. I prefer to set it up as **Shared Resources => Schemas**, but feel free to organize it in a way that suits you best.

3- Within the folder structure created in the previous step, create a new XSD schema. It will serve as the foundation for the messages that will be transformed in this example, I named it as **USER-SCHEMA*. Click on the 'Source' tab and paste the following code, click on the "reparse" and save the project.

~~~xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
	 xmlns="http://www.tibco.com/schemas/XML_TO_JSON_AND_JSON_TO_XML/Shared Resources/Schemas/Schema.xsd"
	 targetNamespace="http://www.tibco.com/schemas/XML_TO_JSON_AND_JSON_TO_XML/Shared Resources/Schemas/Schema.xsd"
	 elementFormDefault="qualified"
	 attributeFormDefault="unqualified">
	<xs:complexType name="UserType">
		<xs:sequence>
			<xs:element name="id" type="xs:string"/>
			<xs:element name="name" type="xs:string"/>
			<xs:element name="email" type="xs:string"/>
		</xs:sequence>
	</xs:complexType>
	<xs:element name="user" type="UserType"/>
	<xs:element name="users">
		<xs:complexType>
			<xs:sequence>
				<xs:element ref="user" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
			</xs:sequence>
		</xs:complexType>
	</xs:element>
</xs:schema>

4- Inside the Shared Resources folder, create a new folder to house the JAVA artifacts. I will name it **Java Artifacts**.

![Image 04](https://github.com/jgimenes/TIBCO-Community/blob/master/images/IMAGE_04_XML_TO_JSON_AND_JSON_TO_XML.png)

5- Download the JAVA [StAXON Core 1.3](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/de/odysseus/staxon/staxon/1.3/staxon-1.3.jar) library and place it in the **Java Artifacts** folder created in the previous step.

6- We will now create an AliasLibrary to map the JAVA library added to the project. The AliasLibrary will enable us to import this library into the Java Code activity, which will handle the message transformations.

7- Choose the previously created **AliasLibrary** and go to the Aliases tab. Click on the **Create and add alias** button, then select the **staxon-1.3.jar** JAR file acquired in step 5.

8- Create a folder to store the processes responsible for performing the transformations. I will name this folder **Processes**.

![Image 08](https://github.com/jgimenes/TIBCO-Community/blob/master/images/IMAGE_08_XML_TO_JSON_AND_JSON_TO_XML.png)

9- Within the **Processes** directory, I will create a new process named **Message Transformation**. This process will handle the transformation of **XML** messages into **JSON** and **JSON** messages into **XML**.
